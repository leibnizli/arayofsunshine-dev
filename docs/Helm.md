# Helm

Helm is a simple `hosts` file manager. Helm develops in swift.

If you have problems that you can't solve, then I recommend you use [gasmask](https://github.com/2ndalpha/gasmask) , it does better than me.

## Install

* Download from Mac <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/helm/id1099472017">App Store</a>.

## Help

After opening, it resides in the menu bar at the upper right corner of the system by default.

The first modification will appear a dialog box for selecting a file. By default, the `hosts` file is selected and confirmed. This is used to authorize read and write permissions.
