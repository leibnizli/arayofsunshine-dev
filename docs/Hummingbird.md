`Hummingbird` uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your files(jpg/png/webp/svg/gif/css/js/html).

![hummingbird](./img/hummingbird.png)

* jpg/png/webp/svg/gif/html will replace the current file after compression, and a new file with .min will be generated after css/js compression
* You can create a `source` folder in the current directory and back up the files before processing, which can be enabled in the settings
