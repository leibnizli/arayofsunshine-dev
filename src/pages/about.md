# About

Hi! I’m Leibniz Li. Thanks for landing on my about page.

I live in the Netherlands, and I’m the guy who manages this blog.

I am currently working as a freelance Web developer here, and apart from developing things for web, I blog here on asunbeam.dev.

You can contact me by <a href="mailto:leibnizli@qq.com">Email</a>.
