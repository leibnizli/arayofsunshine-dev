# About

Hi! I’m Leibniz Li. Thanks for landing on my about page.

I live in Finland, and I’m the guy who manages this blog.

I am currently working as a freelance Web developer here, and apart from developing things for web, I blog here on gotomorrow.dev.

You may keep up with me and the blog by following me at GitHub.
